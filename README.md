Career Guidance System this project is built for SIH-2022.
This web application is built for students of three categories i.e. 10th students, 12th students, and UG students.
This project consists of an MCQs-type quiz, which includes the questionnaires for psychometric tests and aptitude/technical tests, and at the backend, we have a Multiclass classification algorithm that helps in recommending career options. The recommended results include personality type, job roles and roadmap, job domains, government schemes, and higher study options.
It also built the profile for the login student based on the details they have entered and the results received from the tests. <br>
